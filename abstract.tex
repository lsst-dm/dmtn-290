At Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the need to manage metrics and telemetry data efficiently led to the creation of Sasquatch. Sasquatch consolidates our high-frequency telemetry harness, which captures the observatory engineering data, with the science performance metrics measured by the LSST Science Pipelines. Sasquatch utilizes InfluxDB, a time series database, to efficiently store and query time-series data. We combine InfluxDB Enterprise with Apache Kafka and deploy our solution on the Kubernetes platform. Our current setup at the US Data Facility enables real-time access to data mirrored from the Summit and leverages tools like Chronograf for time series data visualization, Kapacitor for alert management, and the Rubin Science Platform's notebook environment for data analysis using Python. Sasquatch is currently employed during Rubin Observatory's System Integration Testing and Commissioning phase and is an essential service as we transition into survey operations.
